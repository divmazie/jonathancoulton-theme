Using cURL to test receiveencode script from command line

On my system:
curl -F file=@/Users/DAM/Music/Logic/Feel/Bounces/feel160.mp3 http://192.168.59.103/api/code/receiveencode/eecb828a97f0b49cac8bedbd2344cf01

General:
curl -F file=@/path/to/file.wav [WORDPRESS_SITE_URL]/api/[AUTHCODE]/receiveencode/[TRANSIENT_KEY]

WORDPRESS_SITE_URL is self explanatory
AUTHCODE accepted anything as of my testing, but should eventually be secure code passed to droplet on creation
TRANSIENT_KEY used to be the encode version hash, but can be anything that WP uses to recover track information
